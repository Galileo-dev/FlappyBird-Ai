# FlappyBird-Ai
As part of the **NUIG Science Festival 2019** I made this flappy bird game in Javascript and then add Ai which used a genetic algorithm to create a bird that can play almost forever.
it will eventually get to a point where the game runs too fast. this was in collaberation with the coderdojo booth at the festival.
